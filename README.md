## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from networksecurity import NetworkSecuritySystem

# Initialize the security system
security_system = NetworkSecuritySystem()

# Start monitoring
security_system.start_monitoring()
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database Configuration
MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Security Settings
THREAT_THRESHOLD=0.8
```

---

## 📊 Data

The system uses the `phisingData.csv` dataset located in the `Network_Data/` directory. This dataset contains:

- Network traffic patterns
- Phishing indicators
- Security threat signatures
- Historical attack data

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Automated data collection and preprocessing
2. **Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature extraction for ML models
3. **Model Training**: Continuous learning and model improvement
4. **Threat Detection**: Real-time threat identification and classification

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGO_DB_URL` | MongoDB connection string | - |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |
| `THREAT_THRESHOLD` | Detection sensitivity | `0.8` |

### Logging Configuration

The system automatically generates timestamped log files in the `logs/` directory with the format:
```
MM_DD_YYYY_HH_MM_SS.log
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t network-security-system .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 network-security-system
```
